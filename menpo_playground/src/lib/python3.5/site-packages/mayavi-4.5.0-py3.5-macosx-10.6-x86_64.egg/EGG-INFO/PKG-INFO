Description: The Mayavi *project* includes two related *packages* for 3-dimensional
        visualization:
        
        - **Mayavi2**: A tool for easy and interactive visualization of data.
        - **TVTK**: A Traits-based wrapper for the Visualization Toolkit, a popular
          open-source visualization library.
        
        These libraries operate at different levels of abstraction. TVTK manipulates
        visualization objects, while Mayavi2 lets you operate on your data, and then
        see the results. Most users either use the Mayavi user interface or program
        to its scripting interface; you probably don't need to interact with TVTK
        unless you want to create a new Mayavi module.
        
        Mayavi2
        -------
        Mayavi2 seeks to provide easy and interactive visualization of 3-D data.
        It offers:
        
        - An (optional) rich user interface with dialogs to interact with all data
          and objects in the visualization.
        - A simple and clean scripting interface in Python, including one-liners,
          or an object-oriented programming interface.
        - The power of the VTK toolkit, harnessed through these interfaces, without
          forcing you to learn it.
        
        Additionally Mayavi2 is a reusable tool that can be embedded in your
        applications in different ways or combined with the Envisage
        application-building framework to assemble domain-specific tools.
        
        
        
        TVTK
        ----
        
        TVTK wraps VTK objects to provide a convenient, Pythonic API, while supporting
        Traits attributes and NumPy/SciPy arrays. TVTK is implemented mostly in pure
        Python, except for a small extension module.
        
        Developers typically use TVTK to write Mayavi modules, and then use Mayavi to
        interact with visualizations or create applications.
        
        Prerequisites

        * `VTK <http://www.vtk.org/>`_ version 5.0 or later
        * One of the following GUI toolkit packages:
            - `Qt <http://www.qt.io>`_ version 4.8 with either PyQt 4.11.4 or PySide 1.2.2
            - `wxPython <http://www.wxpython.org/>`_ version 2.8 or later
        * `configobj <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/configobj>`_
